#QRGenerator
With the QRGenerator you can easily create images of a QR Code, by pasting the link, you want a QR Code for.
The program will make a PNG of the QR Code, which will be placed inside of the package folder.

#Step_By_Step

1. Getting the Link
Firstly, the program will ask you to paste a link for making the QR Code. 
To copy a link for an image, right click on the image and click on "Copy image link".
To copy a normal link, just copy the link you see at the top of you browser.

3. Giving a Name
The program will next ask you to name the image of the QR Code.
You can use names that are seperated by a "_" - for example: my_qr_code or qr_code_image or even rick_roll_qr
DO NOT add a ".png" to the name, the program will automatically add that, when making the QR Code

4. Claiming your QR Code image
The program will next tell you, that it has created the image and that you can find it in the same folder as the package or script.
Navigate and find the image in the same folder and open it.
You can now send the image or scan it yourself.
